# Portfolio Update Plan — AI-Driven Alignment

> Goal: Update portfolio content to align with the new AI-driven Senior Software Engineer resume.

## Overview

Update all sections and locale files (en.json + es.json) to reflect the shift toward AI-assisted development and agentic workflows.

**Reference:** See [`docs/resume.md`](resume.md) for the full AI-driven resume that this plan aligns to.

- ~~Add WhatsApp social link~~ (Skipped — not wanted on Welcome page)
- [ ] (Optional) Update marquee text to include AI-driven identity

**Files:** `src/screens/About/index.tsx` (hardcoded skills), `en.json`, `es.json`

### 2A. Background text

- [x] Rewrite Wizeline `description` to highlight AI-assisted and agentic workflows in `en.json` + `es.json`

### 2D. Resume PDF link

## Section 3: Services

**Files:** `src/screens/Services/index.tsx` (hardcoded serviceIcons), `en.json`, `es.json`
